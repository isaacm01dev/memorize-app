Memorize app : trial version

Hi anyone! If you read this code, please consider this is ment to be only a trial version of a small coding exercice for a future app. Still needs some refactoring and fixing some bugs, as you'll notice if you have a look, and includes only a simple front-end functionality so you can not overload it, but I'm on it...

The app is self-explanatory and it will work as if someone asks you your notes before an exam to check if you learned the lesson...

Hope you find it interesting!
